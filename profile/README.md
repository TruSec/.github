## Hi there 

Thanks for looking into our work. This organisation will be used to publish the TruSec whitepaper and for future development of [the TruSec Protocol that will be presented at Black Hat USA 2022](https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/briefings/schedule/index.html#eliminating-triage-intermediaries-for-zero-day-exploits-using-a-decentralised-payout-protocol-26619). 

The TruSec protocol is derived from the TruCol protocol, which can be inspected [here](https://github.com/TruCol/TruCol), feel free to get [hands on](https://github.com/TruCol/TruCol/issues/10)ðŸ‘‹
